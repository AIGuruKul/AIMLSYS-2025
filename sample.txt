Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It encompasses a wide range of capabilities including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and improve with experience. Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data to make decisions.

Deep Learning is a specialized form of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.

Key Applications:
1. Natural Language Processing
2. Computer Vision
3. Robotics
4. Healthcare diagnostics
5. Autonomous vehicles
